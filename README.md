## Description
This application was created for people in the tech world to be able to write and read blogposts about tech, and leave comments on interesting posts. It also lets you update and delete posts when logged in. This app makes use of node.js, and the npm packages: express.js to run our server, bcrypt to encrypt passwords, sequelize and mysql2 to communicate with our database, dotenv to protect sensitive data in our code, express-handlebars to provide a front-end template, and express-session and connect-session-sequelze to allow the ability for the user to log in and out.

## Installation
To install this application, simply go to its url: [Click to go to application](https://chilling-citadel-47329-94bcd0d8e6c1.herokuapp.com/)  

## Usage 
While logged out you can view the homepage and individual blog posts. The homepage displays all posts with the newest ones on the top of the page. Click on a post to view its contents. If you want to add a comment or post, you need to log in. Click the login button in the header. You will be redirected to the login/signup page. If you already have an account, type your username and password into the given fields and press the login button. You will be logged in and brought back to the homepage. From there you can click on individual posts and leave comments if you would like. If you click on the dashboard button in the header, you will be redirected to your dashboard where it will display your posts if there are any. You can create a new post by clicking the "Create New Blog Post" button on your dashboard. You will then be prompted to enter a title and contents for the post. When you press submit, you will be brought back to your dashboard with the new post displayed at the top of the page. To edit or delete a post that you made, you need to be logged in and go to one of the posts you created. You can do this by clicking on in on the homepage, or clicking on it on your dashboard. You will see options to delete the post or update the post next to the comments button. If you press the delete button, the post will be deleted and you will be brought back to your dashboard. If you press the update button, you will be brought to a page that diplays the blog post in a text box that you can update. After you make the changes you want, press save and you will be brought back to your dashboard with the edited post. To logout, press the logout button or remain idle on the page for 200 seconds (that's how long until the cokkie expires).
